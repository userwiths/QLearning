This thing here represents my own tryes to implement the Q-Learning algorithm.
This is not meant for anything bigger as there are already some giants [TensorFlow,.....]
It is just me fooling around and savin my work.

Q-Learning is a type of reinforced computer learning algorithm.
It allows the computer to check/percept its own enviroment and
act in it. As each action is evaluted in (Q)uality and given a value,
this value is used later to help the computer make the "Best" choice of action.
In order for the computer to learn you must give him the enviroment, penalty, and reward.

The algorithm is related with Markov-Chains [Math,Biology,Chemistry] and
can be reffered to as a [stochastic] procces enviroment -> each state depends [ONLY] on the previous one.
