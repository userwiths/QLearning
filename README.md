This is my implementation of the Q-Learning algorithm.
It is in the category of Machine Learning (ML).
Or even more specifically Reinforced Learning (RL).
Where the "agent" learns about its enviroment by probing
different parts (states) of it.

<ul>
  In its current state is able to:
  <li>[v] Work in user define enviroment with no restriction on actions definition.</li>
  <li>[v] Finding optimal path to a given goal from every point in the enviroment.</li>
  <li>[v] Supports multi-objective learning.</li>
  <li>[!] For each objective the enviroment must be redefined.</li>
  <li>[SOON] Saving already trained models to files, and loading them later.</li>  
</ul>
